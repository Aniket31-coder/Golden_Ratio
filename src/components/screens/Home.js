        <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>What do the Pyramids of Giza and Da Vinciâ€™s Mona Lisa have in common with Sunflower and a human ear? Quick answer: They are all designed using the Golden Ratio.
            The Golden Ratio is a mathematical ratio. It is commonly found in nature, and when used in a design, it fosters organic and natural-looking compositions that are aesthetically pleasing to the eye.

        <h3>Understanding the Maths behind it !</h3>
        <p style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
        The Golden Ratio  exists when a line is divided into two parts and the longer part (a) divided by the smaller part (b) is equal to the sum of (a) + (b) divided by (a), which both equals 1.618 !
        A rectangle whose sides are in the golden ratio, that is (a + b)/a = a/b, where a is the width and a + b is the length of the rectangle is golden rectangle.
